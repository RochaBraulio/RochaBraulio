## Hello there! Iâ€™m Braulio ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m on an exciting journey to become a Data Scientist. With several years of experience in Project Management, Iâ€™ve always been passionate about leveraging data analysis to tackle complex challenges. Now, Iâ€™m channeling that passion into learning Python, machine learning, data analysis, and other essential tools in the field.

My academic background includes a Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s degree in Chemical Engineering, with an emphasis on process modeling. This foundation has equipped me with analytical skills and a systematic approach to problem-solving that Iâ€™m eager to apply in data science.

In my free time, I enjoy working on CAD modeling and 3D printing projects. You can check out my work [here](https://www.printables.com/@3dprintedbyte_451072/models).
